/*The coalesce() function can be useful for specifying a default or backup value when a column contains NULL values.

coalesce() checks arguments in order and returns the first non-NULL value, if one exists.

coalesce(NULL, NULL) = NULL
coalesce(2, 3, NULL) = 2
In the fortune500 data, industry contains some missing values. 
Use coalesce() to use the value of sector as the industry when industry is NULL. 
Then find the most common industry.*/
